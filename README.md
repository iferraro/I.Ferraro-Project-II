# Blog of the Beetle

## Intro
Blog of the Beetle (BOTB) is a site at which users can upload their pictures of the ubiquitous insect. The inspiration for the site was my personal hobby of taking pictures of bugs and documenting their species names. Users who log onto the site are known as contributors. One special feature worth noting is that comments on posts are only visible to the post's owner 

## Planning

## Next Steps
There are two features that would greatly increase the user experience on BOTB. The first would be enabling image uploads directly from a local disk drive, as opposed to only an image link. The second are animations via DOM manipulation, which would turn the wireframe concept into reality. Lastly, displaying the posts chronologically instead of by creator would be more intuitive.
